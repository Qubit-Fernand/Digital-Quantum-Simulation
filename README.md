# Quantum-Simulation
Numerical Experiments for Quantum Simulation Algorithms in the Low Energy Subspace.

Each folder contains a specific approach: Trotter-Suzuki, qDRIFT, Randomized Permutaion and Symmetry Transformation.

Data Availability: For instance, "qDRIFT/raw_1x8.mat" denotes matrix error for 1x8 Heisenberg model induced by the qDRIFT algorithm. Correspondingly, "qDRIFT/norm_1x8_14.mat" denotes the operator norm in full space as well as low-energy subspace with \Delta = 14. Please contact AntiEntropy@pku.edu.cn. for orignial data appearing in the figure.
