Numerical Experiments for Quantum Simulation Algorithms: Trotter-Suzuki, qDRIFT, Randomized Permutaion and Symmetry Transformation.

The "Hamiltonian" folder contains different types of models in which each local term is shifted to semidefinite for subspace projection analysis. In each folder the "test.m" will process matrix data to operator norm according to given low-energy threshold.

Data Availability: For instance, "qDRIFT/raw_1x8.mat" denotes matrix error for 1x8 Heisenberg model induced by the qDRIFT algorithm. Correspondingly, "qDRIFT/norm_1x8_14.mat" denotes the operator norm in full space as well as low-energy subspace with \Delta = 14. Please contact AntiEntropy@pku.edu.cn. for orignial data appearing in the figure.
