# Quantum-Simulation
Numerical Experiments for Quantum Simulation Algorithms in the Low Energy Subspace.
Each folder contains a specific approach: Trotter-Suzuki, qDRIFT, Randomized Permutaion and Symmetry Transformation.
For original data appearing in the paper, (eg. "qDRIFT/raw_1x8.mat" denotes matrix error for 1x8 Heisenberg model induced by the qDRIFT algorithm. Correspondingly, "qDRIFT/norm_1x8_14.mat" denotes the operator norm in full space as well as low-energy subspace with \Delta = 14.) please contact AntiEntropy@pku.edu.cn.
